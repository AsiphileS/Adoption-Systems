            Olive Gomez is a bright and enthusiastic 6-year-old girl with a love for learning and exploring the world around her. She has a warm and friendly personality that draws people in, and she is always eager to make new friends. Olive is in the early stages of developing her independence, enjoying activities like reading simple books, drawing, and playing imaginative games.<br />

            Fluent in both English and a bit of Spanish, Olive enjoys sharing stories and asking questions about the things she encounters. She is curious about the world and has a vivid imagination, often coming up with creative stories or pretending to be different characters while playing. She has a strong interest in arts and crafts, frequently spending time drawing colorful pictures or building things with toys.<br />

            Though Olive can be outgoing and sociable, she can also be a bit shy when meeting new people or in unfamiliar environments. However, once she feels comfortable, she is confident and full of energy, often expressing her thoughts and ideas freely.<br />

            Olive is in need of a stable, loving home where she can continue to grow and feel supported. She thrives in an environment where she can engage in creative activities and where she feels encouraged to learn. With the right family, Olive has the potential to develop into a strong, independent, and compassionate young girl.<br />
