            Sam Xulu is a lively and curious 3-year-old boy with a bright smile and big, expressive eyes. He has been in foster care for most of his young life and is currently awaiting a permanent family.<br /> Despite his early challenges, Sam is full of energy and enjoys exploring the world around him. He loves playing with toys, especially anything that makes noise or moves, and he has a particular fondness for building things with blocks.<br />

            Sam is a resilient child who has learned to adapt to his surroundings, but he thrives when he feels secure and loved. His early experiences have made him more cautious around new people, but once he builds trust, he is affectionate and enjoys receiving attention. Sam enjoys singing and often hums tunes, a source of comfort for him, especially when he feels anxious.<br />

            He is developing his language skills rapidly and loves repeating words he hears, often mimicking the conversations of those around him. Despite his young age, Sam shows an early interest in art, frequently drawing shapes and lines with crayons, and he delights in coloring within the lines when given the chance.

            Sam’s journey to finding a permanent family has been slow, but his cheerful personality and determination shine through every day. He is in need of a loving, stable home where he can continue to grow, learn, and feel truly cared for.
