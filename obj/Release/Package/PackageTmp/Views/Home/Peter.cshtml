        <p class="description">
            Peter Batler is a cheerful and curious 1-year-old boy, with bright eyes and a gentle smile. He is at a stage where he is beginning to explore his world more actively. Though still very young, Peter is already showing signs of a playful and joyful personality. He loves to crawl around, reach for new objects, and explore his surroundings with great curiosity.<br />

            Peter is beginning to make his first words and is fascinated by sounds, often babbling and mimicking the noises he hears. He is at a crucial developmental stage where he is learning to connect with others, and he enjoys being held and comforted. His laughter is infectious, and he tends to light up when he sees familiar faces.<br />

            Though still learning to walk, Peter is very active and loves to engage in simple activities like playing with soft toys, stacking blocks, or interacting with older children. He has a fondness for music and enjoys listening to soothing songs or playing with toys that make sounds.<br />

            Peter has a sweet, calm demeanor but can sometimes get fussy when he feels hungry, tired, or needs attention, which is common at his age. He loves to cuddle, and his gentle nature makes him a joy to be around.<br />

            Currently in foster care, Peter is in need of a loving, stable home where he can receive the care and affection he needs to thrive. With the right family, Peter has the potential to grow up feeling secure, loved, and supported.<br />
