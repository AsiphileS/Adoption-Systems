            Paul Matthews is a sweet and energetic 4-year-old boy with a curious nature and a bright smile. He has been in foster care for a while and is currently waiting for a permanent family. Paul is playful and loves to engage in activities that allow him to explore his environment, such as running around outside, playing with cars, or building structures with blocks.<br />

            Paul is highly social and enjoys interacting with other children and adults alike. He is outgoing and tends to warm up to new people quickly, showing a natural desire to connect. He is particularly fond of stories and often asks others to read him books or tell him stories, showing a budding love for imagination and creativity.<br />

            Despite his friendly nature, Paul has faced some emotional challenges due to the instability in his early life. However, he is resilient and shows great potential for forming strong, positive attachments. When feeling secure, Paul is affectionate, often hugging or holding hands with those he trusts.<br />

            At his age, Paul is developing his speech and vocabulary rapidly, asking lots of questions and showing a keen interest in learning new things. His playful nature is often accompanied by laughter, and he has a contagious giggle that brings joy to those around him. He enjoys drawing, especially scribbling pictures of people and animals, and is starting to show an interest in coloring inside the lines.<br />

            Paul is in need of a loving and stable home where he can feel safe, valued, and continue to grow emotionally and socially. With the right environment, Paul has the potential to thrive and develop into a confident, happy child.
