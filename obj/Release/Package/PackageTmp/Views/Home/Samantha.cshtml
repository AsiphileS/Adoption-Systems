        <p class="description">
            Samantha Zulu is a lively and spirited 2-year-old girl with a bright smile and a curious nature. At this age, she is actively exploring her surroundings and enjoying the simple pleasures of childhood, such as playing with toys, stacking blocks, and moving around. Samantha has a playful energy and loves engaging in activities that allow her to use her imagination and creativity.<br />

            She is becoming more verbal, and while she may not yet speak in full sentences, she is starting to say a few words and can communicate her needs through gestures and simple expressions. Samantha enjoys songs, especially those with catchy rhythms, and she often tries to sing along or clap her hands to the beat.<br />

            Samantha is very affectionate and enjoys being around others, especially when she receives attention and comfort. She is quick to smile and laugh, and her cheerful disposition makes her a joy to be around. Like many toddlers, Samantha has her moments of frustration, especially when she is tired, hungry, or unable to express herself fully, but she is also learning how to manage her emotions with the support of those around her.<br />

            Currently in foster care, Samantha is in need of a loving, stable home where she can feel secure and continue to grow emotionally and socially. With a caring family, Samantha has the potential to thrive, develop strong attachments, and become a confident, happy child.<br />
