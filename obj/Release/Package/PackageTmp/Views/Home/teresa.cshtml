            Teresa Simmons is a vibrant and curious 2-year-old girl, full of energy and personality. With her bright eyes and infectious smile, she brings joy to everyone around her. Teresa is at an age where she is becoming more independent, enjoying exploring her environment and discovering new things. She loves playing with toys, especially those that allow her to stack, sort, or interact with colors and shapes.<br />

            She is beginning to speak and can often be heard repeating simple words, trying to communicate her needs and express her thoughts. Teresa is particularly fond of songs and stories, and she loves to move and dance to music. Her playful spirit is matched by her gentle nature—she enjoys hugging and showing affection to those she trusts.<br />

            Although she is independent in some ways, Teresa still seeks comfort and reassurance from caregivers when she is feeling uncertain. She can become fussy when hungry, tired, or overwhelmed, but her adorable giggles and smiles quickly brighten the room. Teresa is also starting to show interest in social interactions, often mimicking the actions of older children or adults, and she enjoys being around others.<br />

            Having spent time in foster care, Teresa needs a stable, loving home where she can feel safe and secure. With a nurturing environment, Teresa will continue to grow into a happy, confident, and loving child.<br />
